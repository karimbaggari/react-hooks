Sure! Below is a simplified documentation for each of the React hooks you mentioned:

1. **useEffect:**
   - What it does: `useEffect` is used to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the component renders and re-renders.
   - When to use it: Use `useEffect` for tasks like data fetching, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM after rendering.

2. **useState:**
   - What it does: `useState` is used to add state to functional components. It returns a state value and a function to update that state.
   - When to use it: Use `useState` to manage local state within a component, like toggles, form inputs, or any component-specific state.

3. **useCallback:**
   - What it does: `useCallback` memoizes a function, preventing it from being recreated on every render unless its dependencies change.
   - When to use it: Use `useCallback` to optimize performance when passing functions as props to child components, especially in deeply nested component trees.

4. **useDebugValue:**
   - What it does: `useDebugValue` is used to display custom labels for custom hooks in React DevTools.
   - When to use it: Use `useDebugValue` when creating custom hooks to provide more informative labels for easier debugging.

5. **useContext:**
   - What it does: `useContext` allows you to access values from a React context in functional components.
   - When to use it: Use `useContext` to avoid prop drilling and conveniently access global data shared across components.

6. **useMemo:**
   - What it does: `useMemo` memoizes the result of a function and returns the cached result when the dependencies do not change.
   - When to use it: Use `useMemo` to optimize expensive calculations or computations that don't need to be recalculated on every render.

7. **useTransition:**
   - What it does: `useTransition` is used with React Concurrent Mode to transition between pending and resolved states of a Suspense boundary.
   - When to use it: Use `useTransition` when working with Concurrent Mode to create smooth transitions during data fetching or suspense handling.

8. **useImperativeHandle:**
   - What it does: `useImperativeHandle` customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using `ref`.
   - When to use it: Use `useImperativeHandle` when you want to expose certain methods or properties of a child component to its parent using `ref`.

9. **useRef:**
   - What it does: `useRef` returns a mutable object that persists between renders and doesn't trigger re-rendering when its value changes.
   - When to use it: Use `useRef` to keep track of values that don't require re-rendering, like getting a reference to a DOM element or storing previous state values.

10. **useReducer:**
    - What it does: `useReducer` is an alternative to `useState`, used for managing more complex state logic that involves multiple actions.
    - When to use it: Use `useReducer` when you have state transitions that are more suitable to be handled by a reducer function, especially when the state logic becomes intricate.

Remember, while this documentation provides a simplified overview of each hook, it's essential to consult the official React documentation or additional resources for more in-depth explanations and examples. Hooks can be powerful tools when used correctly and can greatly enhance the functionality and performance of your React components.
